# Content Toolkit
#Main Comparison Dashboards:

Here you can compare on-prem content and Cloud content. Go to the source and check the pre-requisites.

If you would like to call the environment main, replace $lookup$. i.e $lookup$_all_dashboards.csv would be called main_all_dashboards.csv and upload it like this.

Exclude: Click on the apps you donâ€™t want to see populating.

Missing: By default is set up to true in order to check all missing KOs.

Environment: This is the name of the environment, this is used on the lookups.

#Data Validator:

Here you can check if all buckets from on-prem were migrated.

Check the source and pre-requisites, then assign the correct name to the lookup

#Useful dashboards:

Event Parser: Parse your data using the magic 8.

Data Quality: Check the sourcetypes with issues and use this dashboard to identify better and faster the main issues.
